# Swift for apps, server-side, CLI, and developer tooling

I build and maintain open-source projects focused on practical Swift usage.

My work centers on applying Swift where its type system, performance, and tooling
provide clear advantages — across application code, server-side services,
command-line tools, and developer workflows.

The emphasis is on real-world code: maintainable, expressive, and suitable for
long-lived projects.

## Selected Projects

### [Hokusai](https://github.com/ivantokar/hokusai), [HokusaiVapor](https://github.com/ivantokar/hokusai-vapor)
Image processing and tooling written in Swift.  
Focused on non-UI workloads and server-side use cases.

### [xmap.nvim](https://github.com/ivantokar/xmap.nvim)
A Neovim plugin written in Lua, focused on Swift code navigation,  
with support for additional languages such as TypeScript and Markdown.

## Direction

I focus on practical Swift usage for tooling and systems,
building quality-of-life tools for solo developers and small teams,
based on my own workflows.

Most of this work happens in Neovim.
