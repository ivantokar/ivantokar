# Swift for server-side, CLI, and developer tooling

Open-source tools built with Swift.

My work focuses on practical use of Swift across server-side services,
command-line applications, and developer tooling. I apply Swift where
its type system, performance, and tooling are a good fit.

## Selected Projects

### Hokusai
Image processing and tooling written in Swift.  
Focused on non-UI workloads and server-side use cases.

with support for additional languages such as TypeScript and Markdown.

## Direction

My work centers on practical Swift usage for tooling and systems.
I build quality-of-life tools for solo developers, based on my own workflows.

Neovim is where most of this work happens.
